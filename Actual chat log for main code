### Explanation

- The function `find_highest_and_lowest_loan_amnts` reads the CSV data, splits it into lines, and extracts the header and data rows.
- It finds the index of the [`loan_amnt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fthoma%2FDownloads%2Fimproved%20dataset%2Fimproved%20dataset.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A99%7D%7D%5D%2C%2265b128ee-1e84-4d81-953c-fefd543554c1%22%5D "Go to definition") column and initializes variables to store the highest and lowest loan amounts.
- It iterates over each data row, extracts the [`loan_amnt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fthoma%2FDownloads%2Fimproved%20dataset%2Fimproved%20dataset.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A99%7D%7D%5D%2C%2265b128ee-1e84-4d81-953c-fefd543554c1%22%5D "Go to definition") value, and updates the highest and lowest loan amounts accordingly.
- Finally, it returns the highest and lowest loan amounts.

### Explanation

- The function `find_highest_and_lowest_loan_amnts` reads the CSV data, splits it into lines, and extracts the header and data rows.
- It finds the index of the [`loan_amnt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fthoma%2FDownloads%2Fimproved%20dataset%2Fimproved%20dataset.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A99%7D%7D%5D%2C%227da778ec-ff74-4319-8d18-ad177a3a8eaa%22%5D "Go to definition") column and initializes variables to store the highest and lowest loan amounts.
- It iterates over each data row, extracts the [`loan_amnt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fthoma%2FDownloads%2Fimproved%20dataset%2Fimproved%20dataset.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A99%7D%7D%5D%2C%227da778ec-ff74-4319-8d18-ad177a3a8eaa%22%5D "Go to definition") value, and updates the highest and lowest loan amounts accordingly.
- Finally, it returns the highest and lowest loan amounts.

GitHub Copilot: ### Plan

1. Read the CSV data from the string.
2. Split the data into lines.
3. Extract the header and data rows.
4. Parse the [`loan_amnt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fthoma%2FDownloads%2Fimproved%20dataset%2Fimproved%20dataset.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A99%7D%7D%5D%2C%2205b3b1b4-dc64-45f6-b18d-d8f1722ed264%22%5D "Go to definition") values from each row.
5. Determine the highest and lowest [`loan_amnt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fthoma%2FDownloads%2Fimproved%20dataset%2Fimproved%20dataset.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A99%7D%7D%5D%2C%2205b3b1b4-dc64-45f6-b18d-d8f1722ed264%22%5D "Go to definition") values.
6. Return the highest and lowest values.
